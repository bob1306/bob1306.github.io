  <h1 class="standard_title">Dungeons are Boring</h1>
  <p class="standard_dis">This was a video game that I developed with three other programmers. My main responsibilities were the <span class="standard_highlight">art design, character design, game mechanism</span> and <span class="standard_highlight">level design</span>. The camera view is two-dimensional (2D), resulting in a top-view of the gameplay. The game is composed of levels, each of which is substantially a boss fight. Main purpose of the game is to defeat the enemies while controlling the Hero’s boredom.

    	<h2 class="standard_h2">Gameplay Synopsis</h2>
    	<p class="standard_h2dis">You play as an extremely skilled adventurer, who've seen almost everything in his career, and your main goal as the player is to clear the dungeon without boring him. You will be fighting huge monsters and deadly bosses - well, deadly for everyone else, not for our hero, of course - while you fight The Hero's boredom: if he's tired enough by those enemies, the hero will self-impose challenges to increase difficulty, and to found again the long lost fighting spirit.
        </p>
        <p class="standard_h2dis">
        <span style="font-weight: 600;color: #0f0f0f">The real enemy is The Hero!</span> - Fight The Hero's boredom by completing his challenges. Don't let The Hero 100% bored, or you will lose!
        </p>
        <p class="standard_h2dis">
        <span style="font-weight: 600;color: #0f0f0f">Over 30 unique challenges!</span> - Who knows what boredom could suggest The Hero?

        </p>
        <p class="standard_h2dis">
        <span style="font-weight: 600;color: #0f0f0f">No more boring dungeons!</span> -  Immediately jump to the final boss fight, because boss fights should be the fun part, right?
        </p>
        <p class="standard_h2dis">
        <span style="font-weight: 600;color: #0f0f0f">100% Sarcastic Hero!</span> - The Hero will have to comment almost everything that happens in-game.

    <p class="standard_h2dis">The hero is an extremely experienced adventurer, who can't seem to find anything exciting in his job anymore. He's been slaying monsters for years, and his power and equipment are legend materials - it is said his mighty sword can behead even the strongest enemy with just one hit.

    <p class="standard_h2dis">Feline creature covered in blue-black fur, similar to a panther. Its overworld origins are clear in its six legs and two tentacles coming out from its shoulders. Its eyes glow yellowish and can be seen even in the darkest night. Before being sealed away from the world, it was said to prey upon human flesh. Considered to be one of the strongest predators, it was quite impossible for preys to escape its hunt: its ambushes were said to be deadly, as it could travel extremely long distances in the blink of an eye.

    <p class="standard_h2dis">Banshees are female spirits ruling the dark feys, often described as ugly, long-haired woman. They are said to always be weeping and lamenting, so they are often associated with death presages. A banshee’s shout can instantly kill whoever listens to it. A banshee can't bear to see the horror of its own appearance. Seeing itself sends them into a rage: because of this, banshees hates any mirrored surfaces. Macha is one of the Three Morrignas Sisters, along with Nemain and Morrigan. Later in the fight she will summon both of them.
